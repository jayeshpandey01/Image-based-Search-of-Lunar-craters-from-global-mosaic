# SAR Images Colorization Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN)

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the interpretability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by applying deep learning techniques, specifically Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), to colorize monochromatic SAR images. SAR images are inherently difficult to interpret due to their grayscale nature, and adding color can improve visual analysis for various applications such as land cover classification, geological mapping, and spaceborne imagery analysis.

## Objectives
- Colorize SAR images using deep learning techniques to make them more interpretable.
- Develop a robust deep learning model that generalizes well to various types of SAR images.
- Improve visualization for applications such as remote sensing, space exploration, and earth observation.

## Dataset

We use SAR grayscale images as input data. Each image is processed through the DCNN to predict color values, and the corresponding RGB color images serve as the output. The dataset structure follows a standard train-test-validation split for model training and evaluation. The images used in this project are from:
- [Dataset Source 1]
- [Dataset Source 2]

Ensure to download and place the images in the `dataset/` directory following the structure provided.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) with several convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions to extract spatial features from the SAR images. The architecture follows these key principles:
1. **Input Layer:** Accepts monochromatic SAR images.
2. **Convolutional Layers:** Extracts spatial features from the input images.
3. **UpSampling Layers:** Helps in restoring the spatial resolution for colorization.
4. **Output Layer:** Predicts the RGB channels for the input grayscale image.

The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and can be trained on GPUs for faster execution.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/SAR-Images-DCNN.git
cd SAR-Images-DCNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the SAR images and apply any necessary transformations:

```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
```

2. **Model Training**  
Train the DCNN model using the preprocessed dataset:

```bash
python scripts/model_training.py
```

3. **Model Evaluation**  
Evaluate the model performance on the test dataset:

```bash
python scripts/model_evaluation.py
```

4. **Colorize SAR Images**  
After the model is trained, use it to colorize new SAR images:

```bash
python scripts/colorize_images.py --input_path path/to/monochrome/images --output_path path/to/save/colorized/images
```

## Results

The model outputs colorized versions of the SAR images, which are stored in the `results/colorized_samples/` directory. Here is a sample comparison between the original grayscale image and the colorized output:

| Original Image | Colorized Image |
|----------------|-----------------|
|![Grayscale](results/sample_original.png) | ![Colorized](results/sample_colorized.png)|

## Challenges
- **SAR Image Quality:** SAR images are often noisy due to radar reflections, making the colorization process more challenging.
- **Generalization:** Ensuring the model generalizes well across different terrain types and geographies.
- **Training Time:** High computational resources are required for training on large datasets.

## Future Work
- Improve model architecture to handle noise in SAR images better.
- Experiment with GANs for more realistic colorization.
- Extend the model to handle multi-channel SAR data for more advanced applications.

# SAR Images Colorization Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN)

## Overview

This project focuses on colorizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). The objective is to enhance the interpretability of SAR images by adding color to grayscale imagery, facilitating better visual analysis for applications in remote sensing, geological mapping, and spaceborne data analysis.

## Objectives
- Develop a DCNN-based model to colorize SAR images.
- Improve the visual quality and interpretability of SAR data.
- Address challenges such as noise and generalization across various types of SAR images.

## Dataset
The dataset includes grayscale SAR images that serve as input and their corresponding RGB images as output. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Architecture
The DCNN architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by upsampling layers to generate the RGB color channels from grayscale input. The model is designed to efficiently handle the unique characteristics of SAR images.

## Results
The model successfully colorizes grayscale SAR images, enhancing their interpretability. Results are stored and visualized in the `results` directory, comparing the original grayscale images with their colorized counterparts.

## Challenges
- Handling noise in SAR images.
- Achieving generalization across diverse SAR datasets.
- High computational resources required for training.

## Future Work
- Explore GAN-based approaches for more realistic colorization.
- Expand the model to work with multi-channel SAR data.
- Improve robustness against noisy input data.
